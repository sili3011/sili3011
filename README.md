I like to develop fun projects that support my hobbies and learn new technologies while I am at it.  
Currently I am working on [‚öñÔ∏è tradingpost](https://mtg-tradingpost.com), a Magic: The Gahtering collection-manager/deck-builder/card-detector Angular app with a node backend server to support it.
